# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a typographic designer and font engineer, crafting software and fonts over at [Typotheque](https://www.typotheque.com). While my work often resides backstage, you've probably crossed paths with some of the [fonts](https://www.typotheque.com/authors/roberto-arista/fonts) I've worked on in the space around you.

From 2021 to 2023, Iâ€™ve helped [@typemytype](https://github.com/typemytype) to keep the [RoboFont documentation](https://robofont.com) in good shape and I took care to update to latest APIs some frequently used open-source RoboFont plugins.

In 2017, I published [pythonfordesigners.com](https://pythonfordesigners.com), an open-source manual aimed at empowering designers with Python programming skills. Feel free to explore the [repository](https://github.com/roberto-arista/PythonForDesigners) for the source code of the website.
